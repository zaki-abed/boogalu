                BOOGALUU processes personal information on its servers in the India and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We provide personal and non-personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted third parties or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such personal information based on our instructions and in compliance with the appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We may also disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on BOOGALUU or its parent company, subsidiaries, or affiliates, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of BOOGALUU or the users of the Website, or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Website. 
            </p>
            <p>
                SECTION 2 - Choices for personal information When you sign up for the Service, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, and you decline, BOOGALUU may not be able to provide its Service to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                SECTION 3 - Maintenance of personal information You can access your information contained in BOOGALUU’s database by emailing us on info@boogaluu.com .

In the text of your email, specify which notifications you no longer wish to receive and provide your exact name, email address and/or address so that we can do our best to ensure that you stop receiving the notifications that you no longer wish to receive. After such a request is received, BOOGALUU will use reasonable efforts to refrain from including you when sending such notifications to BOOGALUU’s visitors/users/customers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not currently maintain any procedures for you to review the information that we collect about you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                SECTION 4 - Retention of personal information When you close or de-activate your account or if your account is otherwise terminated, we have the right, but not the obligation, to store your personal information, settings, saved and completed classes, and teachers you have followed.
            </p>
            <p>
                SECTION 5 - Information Security We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We restrict access to personal information to BOOGALUU employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, please note that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so while BOOGALUU strives to protect your information, BOOGALUU cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you voluntarily give to BOOGALUU. 
            </p>
            <p>
                SECTION 6 - Accessing and updating personal information When you use the Services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
